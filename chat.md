# HEARD Development: Vibe-Coding Chat (Prompts to AI)

<br>

## AI Tools Used: 
1. Anima (https://dev.animaapp.com/) - for generating a frontend to start with
2. Microsoft Copilot (https://copilot.microsoft.com/) - for increasing mobile-friendliness

<br>

## Usage of Anima
* Prompt 1: "I need a web app for a platform called Heard. Please generate web pages according to the designs shown in the screenshots."
    * Response Summary: Anima generated a React-based frontend consistent with the design samples I included with the prompt.

* Prompt 2: "Here are samples for some of the other pages. Follow them."
    * Response Summary: Anima generated further webpages according to the new images I included in the prompt.

* Prompt 3: "The dropdown appears at an incorrect position (at the left while it is supposed to be below the "More" button). Also, the navbar button texts should be wrapped in a horizontally centred alignment when the screen is narrow."
    * Response Summary: Anima fixed issues and adjusted the code accordingly to meet the requirements stated in the prompt.

## Usage of Copilot
* Prompt: "[Long code provided.] How to make the navbar mobile-friendly? It doesn't wrap according to mobile screen dimensions. Tell me if I need to include more code."
    * Response Summary: Copilot regenerated the code for the navigation bar such that it is mobile-friendly. (Other aspects of the frontend appear to be adjusted for mobile already.)
